            <p>
                Hi! I’m Stuart, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego in the Department of
                Communication and the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I’m an interpretive social scientist by
                training with a background in the humanities, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and
                data science to make trouble. My research, teaching, and broader service are all grounded in the idea
                that science and technology are inherently social activities, which are directed, operated, and
                maintained (or not) in certain ways and not others, by people in and between institutions.
            </p>
